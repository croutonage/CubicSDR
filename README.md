CubicSDR
========

I am not the author of this application, I just:

added 2.16M Samplerate, Useful due to being a multiple of both 28.8 and 48k, the xtal in the rtl, and the audio output. Allows decimation without needing resampling to optimize cpu use
Hardcoded a ppm offset into CubicSDRDefs.h for one of my sticks (ppm0)
Removed AGC and hardcoded to '38' as gain to suit E4000 under most uses
Changed fft from 2048 to 16k as my pc will handle it and it looks prettier

Top notch effort by the author on the recent changes, http://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/comments/2yi1r9/cubicsdr_v011beta_for_win64_and_osx_plus/

Advanced Goals:
---------------
  - Design a plan for expansion via modules (dylib/dll/lua)
  - Support shell-based stdin/stdout tools for direct output/playback to/from CLI audio processing apps (i.e. DSD on OSX)
  - Update visuals to support OpenGL ES
  - Basic demodulator filter(s) that can be enabled and tweaked visually
  - Support multiple simultaneous device usage
    * Categorize devices by antenna connections
    * Allow locked frequencies to activate unused devices to continue demodulation on same antenna
  - Implement digital demodulation supported by liquid-dsp: (http://liquidsdr.org/doc/modem.html)
    * PSK, DPSK, ASK, QAM, APSK, BPSK, QPSK, OOK, SQAM, Star Modem(?)
  - Integrate LUA
    * Expose liquid-dsp functionality
    * Scriptable liquid-dsp demodulation
    * Scriptable digital demodulation output handlers
      - Create block output devices on *nix?
      - Create socket outputs?
      - Visual outputs?
    * Take control of additional devices and spawning new demodulators (i.e. trunkers)
    * Script manager / live editor
    * Provide scriptable liquid-dsp modulation for trancievers?
  - "PVR" like mode with waterfall time shifting
  - L/R and surround-sound balance settings for separating and listening to mono streams
  - Add tool for converting decimated I/Q recording to video
    - Select video features such as title/demodulation/scope/waterfall/etc
    - Render to video from GL frames->ffmpeg/mencoder /w demodulated audio
  - Accessability / Control
    - USB/MIDI control surfaces
    - Joystick / gamepad input
    - Vibration / force-feeback
  - Investigate compilation via emscripten using rtl_tcp for input
    - Create web server+rtl_tcp bundle for embedded devices
    - Use emscripten compiled CubicSDR via embedded web server
